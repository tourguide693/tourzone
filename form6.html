<h1>NANDI HILLS</h1>
<p class="w3-text-red">What is the best time to visit Nandi Hills?
Summer, Winter and Monsoon are equally great to visit Nandi Hills, as it has a pleasant weather throughout the year. However, afternoons could be sweltering during summers, so plan your trip either early in the morning on late in the evening. Monsoons, are also be less advisable due to rainfall as the road could be slippery and it gets difficult to climb up the hill.
